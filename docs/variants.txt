Na, Nm, Nc : the number of complete blocks of associated data, plaintext, and ciphertextmessage, respectively
Ina, Inm, Inc : binary variables equal to 1 if the last block of the respective data type is incomplete, and 0 otherwise
NPUB[5..0] : Refers to the last five least significant binary digits in the public message number, NPUB. Used for calculating the first offset in OCB mode authenticated encryption/decryption
